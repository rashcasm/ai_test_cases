# API Integration Test Suite

This repository contains **integration tests** for a backend server that handles authentication and booking management for a car rental system.

The tests are written to check whether important API endpoints are behaving correctly when hit like a real client.

> ⚠️ **Important:**
>
> - This repo **does NOT start the backend**
> - The backend server must already be running
> - Tests hit real HTTP endpoints

## What is tested in this repo?

This repo focuses on two main areas:

1. **Authentication APIs** (signup, login)
2. **Booking Management APIs** (create, read, update, delete bookings)

---

## 🔐 Authentication APIs

### Signup (`POST /auth/signup`)

Signup tests cover:

- Creating a new user successfully
- Rejecting duplicate usernames
- Rejecting requests with missing or invalid fields
- Making sure passwords are **never leaked** in responses

#### Expected behavior

| Scenario                | Status Code | Notes                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Successful signup       | `201`       | Returns `userId`       |
| Username already exists | `409`       | Error message expected |
| Missing username        | `400`       | Validation error       |
| Missing password        | `400`       | Validation error       |
| Invalid request body    | `400`       | Validation error       |
| Unexpected server error | `500`       | Generic error message  |

Password must **never** be returned in any signup response.

---

### Login (`POST /auth/login`)

Login tests cover:

- Logging in with correct credentials
- Rejecting wrong passwords
- Rejecting non-existent users
- Rejecting requests with missing fields
- Ensuring token is returned **only on success**

#### Expected behavior

| Scenario                | Status Code | Notes                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Successful login        | `200`       | Token must be returned |
| User does not exist     | `401`       | No token               |
| Incorrect password      | `401`       | No token               |
| Missing username        | `400`       | Validation error       |
| Missing password        | `400`       | Validation error       |
| Invalid request body    | `400`       | Validation error       |
| Unexpected server error | `500`       | Generic error message  |

Token must **never** be present in error responses.

## 🚗 Booking Management APIs

All booking endpoints require authentication via JWT token in the Authorization header.

### Create Booking (`POST /bookings`)

Creates a new car rental booking for the authenticated user.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "carName": "BMW",
  "days": 3,
  "rentPerDay": 1000
}
```

#### Tests cover:

- Creating a booking successfully with valid data
- Calculating total cost correctly (`days * rentPerDay`)
- Rejecting requests without authentication token
- Rejecting invalid input (empty car name, missing fields)
- Enforcing business rules:
  - `days` must be between 1 and 365
  - `rentPerDay` must be greater than 0
  - `carName` cannot be empty
- Strict schema validation (rejecting extra fields)
- All new bookings created with status `"Booked"`

#### Expected behavior

| Scenario                   | Status Code | Notes                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Successful creation        | `201`       | Returns `bookingId`, `totalCost` |
| Missing authentication     | `401`       | No token provided                |
| Invalid fields             | `400`       | Validation error                 |
| Days > 365                 | `400`       | Business rule violation          |
| RentPerDay = 0 or negative | `400`       | Business rule violation          |
| Empty carName              | `400`       | Validation error                 |
| Extra fields in body       | `400`       | Strict schema enforcement        |

---

### Get Bookings (`GET /bookings`)

Retrieves booking information for the authenticated user. This endpoint supports three modes via query parameters.

#### Mode 1: Get all user bookings (no query params)

```
GET /bookings
```

Returns an array of all bookings for the current user, ordered by creation date (newest first).

#### Mode 2: Get specific booking by ID

```
GET /bookings?bookingId=abc123
```

Returns a single booking object if it belongs to the authenticated user.

#### Mode 3: Get booking summary

```
GET /bookings?summary=true
```

Returns aggregated statistics for the user's bookings.

**Response format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "username": "john_doe",
    "totalBookings": 5,
    "totalAmountSpend": 15000
  }
}
```

> **Note on summary calculation:**  
> The tests assume that the summary endpoint only counts bookings with status `"Booked"` or `"Completed"` when calculating `totalBookings` and `totalAmountSpend`. This is based on the backend implementation where cancelled or pending bookings might exist but shouldn't be included in spending totals.

#### Tests cover:

- Returning all bookings for a user
- Returning a specific booking by ID
- Returning summary with correct calculations
- Preventing simultaneous use of `summary` and `bookingId` parameters
- Returning empty array when user has no bookings
- Preventing users from accessing other users' bookings
- Returning zero values in summary when no bookings exist

#### Expected behavior

| Scenario                           | Status Code | Notes                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Get all bookings                   | `200`       | Returns array of bookings     |
| Get booking by ID (exists)         | `200`       | Returns single booking object |
| Get booking by ID (doesn't exist)  | `404`       | Booking not found             |
| Get booking owned by another user  | `404`       | Authorization check           |
| Get summary                        | `200`       | Returns aggregated stats      |
| Use both `summary` and `bookingId` | `400`       | Conflicting parameters        |
| No bookings exist                  | `200`       | Returns empty array or zeros  |

---

### Update Booking (`PUT /bookings/:id`)

Updates an existing booking. Users can update `days`, `rentPerDay`, or both.

#### Request Body (partial update allowed)

```json
{
  "days": 5,
  "rentPerDay": 800
}
```

#### Tests cover:

- Updating booking fields successfully
- Allowing partial updates (only `days` or only `rentPerDay`)
- Preventing users from updating other users' bookings
- Requiring authentication
- Rejecting empty request body
- Updating total cost automatically

#### Expected behavior

| Scenario                      | Status Code | Notes                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Successful update             | `200`       | Returns updated booking   |
| Update another user's booking | `403`       | Forbidden                 |
| No authentication token       | `401`       | Unauthorized              |
| Empty request body            | `400`       | At least one field needed |
| Booking doesn't exist         | `404`       | Not found                 |

---

### Delete Booking (`DELETE /bookings/:id`)

Deletes a booking by ID.

#### Tests cover:

- Deleting a booking successfully
- Requiring authentication
- Preventing deletion of non-existent bookings
- Preventing double deletion

#### Expected behavior

| Scenario                    | Status Code | Notes           |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Successful deletion         | `200`       | Booking deleted |
| No authentication token     | `401`       | Unauthorized    |
| Booking doesn't exist       | `404`       | Not found       |
| Deleting same booking twice | `404`       | Already deleted |

---

## Error Messages Expected by Tests

Some tests assert exact error messages. Backend should return these messages for corresponding cases.

### Signup

- `"username already exists"`
- `"Internal server error"` (for unexpected failures)

### Login

- `"user does not exist"`
- `"incorrect password"`
- `"Internal server error"` (for unexpected failures)

### Bookings

- `"Cannot use summary and bookingId together"`
- `"bookingId not found"`

Validation-related errors can return any reasonable message, but must use the correct status code (`400`).

---

## General Error Rules

- Validation errors → `400`
- Authentication failures → `401`
- Authorization failures (accessing other user's data) → `403`
- Resource not found → `404`
- Conflicts (duplicate data) → `409`
- Server crashes / unexpected issues → `500`
- Internal errors must **not** leak stack traces, DB errors, or library names

---

## Running the Tests

1. Make sure your backend server is running
2. Configure the base URL in your test environment
3. Run tests:
   `npm test`

---

## Test Assumptions

These tests are written based on certain backend implementation assumptions:

1. **Booking Summary Calculation:**  
   The `GET /bookings?summary=true` endpoint is assumed to only count bookings with status `"Booked"` or `"Completed"` when calculating totals. This means cancelled, pending, or other status bookings are excluded from the spending summary.

2. **Status Field:**  
   All newly created bookings are assumed to have a default status of `"Booked"`.

3. **Authentication:**  
   All booking endpoints require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

4. **User Isolation:**  
   Users can only access, modify, or delete their own bookings. Attempting to access another user's booking results in a `404` (not `403`) to avoid leaking information about booking existence.

---

## Security Notes

- Passwords are never returned in any API response
- Authentication tokens are only provided on successful login
- Users cannot access or modify other users' bookings
- Strict input validation prevents injection attacks
- Schema validation rejects unexpected fields

---

## Contributing
